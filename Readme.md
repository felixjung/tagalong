Description
===========
Tagalong is a small web app that displays a series of tweets containing the hashtag #sumup. The server component is written using Node.js and Express. The front-end is written in AngularJS with style sheets generated by Sass.

Requirements
============
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://github.com/npm/npm) installed to install server and gulp dependencies. The client component does not require any setup. For development purposes you should have [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [sass](http://sass-lang.com) installed.

Usage
=====
1. Run ``npm install`` from the terminal to install Node.js dependencies.
2. Rename ``config.example.js`` to ``config.js`` and enter your Twitter consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret.
3. Launch gulp by calling ``gulp`` from terminal to launch the node server and have the webpage be served from browser-sync's static webserver and opened in Google Chrome.

Todo
====
- [ ] Implement Twitter's streaming API.
- [ ] Add option to set the number of tweets to display at a time.
- [ ] Add pages, if the total number of tweets exceeds the maximum tobe displayed.
- [ ] Add a search field that allows to search for tags rather than just for #sumup.
- [ ] Implement fancy animations.
